The bride turns and says you better not mess this up.When the groom’s mom hears the question she says “hopeless ,him and shopping spots ,not a chance”. Then the groom says confidently that “I’ll get one point for sure, phew” and he answers the question right as South India shopping mall. Everyone is surprised that he got it right and applauds !!!'
