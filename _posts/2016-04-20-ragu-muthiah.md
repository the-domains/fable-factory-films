Welcome to Fable Factory Films. 

We are a creative production company based in Chennai, India.

Fable Factory Films was
founded in 2003 by Ragu Muthiah and has become one of the top ranking production companies in south india for
commercials, digital films, animation films & music videos.

Fable Factory Films has curated a roster of
exceptional directors and writers. With the conviction that storytelling is the
most powerful form of messaging, their work utilises whatever technology is
necessary to target a market - or create one - and break down the barriers that
stand between an advertiser and their desired audience.

Our directors and producers are always looking for original and
creative experiences. We are committed to high production values in all of our
commercials, music videos and digital content. We are a pro-active and positive
team who want to work together with our clients to deliver outstanding films.
